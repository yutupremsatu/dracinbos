DracinBos Migration Notes
=========================

REQUIRED FILES NOT IN GIT:
1. .env.local (This file contains your Supabase secrets!)
2. android/app/release-key.jks (Old keystore, kept just in case)

INSTRUCTIONS FOR NEW LAPTOP:
1. Install Git and Node.js (v18+)
2. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/yutupremsatu/dracinbos.git
   
3. Copy the `.env.local` from this zip into the root folder `dracinbos/`.
4. Install dependencies:
   npm install

5. Run:
   npm run dev

NOTE: 
- The NEW keystore (`dracinku-release.jks`) IS inside the git repo, so you don't need to copy it manually.
- Database is in the cloud (Supabase), so all user data will appear automatically.
